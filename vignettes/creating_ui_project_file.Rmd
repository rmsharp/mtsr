Use YAML key value pair format to create a data file that will be used to 
create the user interface for data collection.  The first 25 lines of the
example data file shown below:

```{r 1st-25-lines-of-example-project-yml, comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat(example_project_text[1:25], sep = "\n")
```
