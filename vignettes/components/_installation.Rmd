### github.com Installation

The current development version can be 
installed from GitHub.
[github.com/rmsharp/crosssectiontimer](
https://github.com/rmsharp/crosssectiontimer) 
as all of the dependencies are automatically installed.

You can install **crosssectiontimer** from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmsharp/crosssectiontimer")

```

All missing dependencies should be automatically installed except for those
found in rmsutilityr, which is available at my github account.

You can install **rmsutilityr** from github with:

```{r gh-rmsutilityr-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
